This year's Spring Festival was similar to previous years. After a long traffic jam, I returned to the countryside. After that, it was just parties, dinners and more parties. After repeating this several times, I returned to ShenZhen on a cold morning. During the remaining days of the vacation, I thought about how to spend the time. Before the Spring Festival, I saw some interesting exhibitions on social media, and I heard that a professional football field nearby was about to be completed, so I decided to go there.

It was pretty cold this morning. Although the weather app said the feels-like temperature was only 4 degrees, the sunlight made it feel quite warm. Sometimes I encountered similar weather during my commute on usual days, and I thought it would be nice to go out and enjoy it. But on my days off, I often wake up and do noting, and before I know it, it's already afternoon. After lunch, I take a nap and wake up again, and by then, it's already 3 o'clock. By this time, the only activity left is to take a walk for an hour or two and then head back home. Many of my weekends are like this, and it feels pretty boring. So this time, I wanted to go out early and spend as much time as possible outdoors.

At the end of vacation, many stores were still closed. So I had breakfast at a nearby McDonald's. Then I took the metro to the Children's Palace. When I exited the station, I saw that the Children's Palace was surrounded by walls, with a sign at the gate that said 'Renovation Project'. On the other side was the Museum of Contemporary Art and Urban Planning. Besides the usual urban planning exhibition, there were also exhibitions about Guan Gong and Tencent. In the square in front of the museum, there were many penguin statues, which are Tencent's mascots, and many people were taking photos with them.

After a few turns at the entrance, I entered the museum. The first exhibition I visited was the urban planning exhibit. I have always been fascinated by various models and landscapes, such as Gundam model toys, exquisite bonsai, the game boards form the Civilization series, and even models of rail transit planning. The city models in the exhibition naturally caught my attention the most, while I had little interest in the planning itself. In the game "City Skyline", I tend to be casual with large-scale plans like road networks and functional zoning, preferring to focus on sculpting the smaller, detailed landscapes. Therefore, in this exhibit, I spent most of my time admiring the models.

To the left inside the museum was a large-scale model of Shenzhen, covering an area about the size of half basketball court, stretching form Bao'an in the east to Dapeng in the west. The peaks of the mountains aligned with the roads, with clusters of buildings nestled between them, and lakes and oceans added as embellishments. One ten million people live here. Objectively speaking, this model wasn't particularly impressive or detailed, but I still walked around it a few times. I thought about where I live, where I work, the places I've visited, and the stories that happened in certain areas.

The remaining models in the museum depicted more localized parts of the city. With the camera zoomed in, the details became more apparent. The buildings were no longer just white blocks; the addition of decorative elements made the visuals much more pleasing. There were also individual models of landmark builders, such as the airport, the Citizen Center, Ping An Tower, etc. but due to space constraints, I won't include all the pictures here. The exhibition's substantive content was limited; apart form the models, there were various graphic and video materials, which were somewhat tedious. After quickly browsing through, I left the exhibition.

The afternoon was relatively simply. The Sports Center was still under construction, so I planned to visit the nearby Bijia Mountain to get a distant view. The hike up wasn't long. After walking along the mountain road for about an hour, I reached the summit. Both peaks of Bijia Mountain have observation decks. The viewpoints aren't very different, and both offer a panoramic view of the Sports Center. The construction seems to be nearing completion, with only some interior finishing work left. Externally, there no noticeable sign of ongoing construction.

As a football fan, I certainly don't want to miss the experience of watching a match in a professional stadium. However, there are hardly any such opportunities in the Pearl River Delta. If want to watch a match in Hong Kong, travel and accommodation costs are quite high, so I haven't been able to fulfill that wish. After this stadium is completed, it will host some Chinese Super League matches, so I'll be able to go and experience it firsthand.

For my return trip, I chose to walk to Bijia Mountain Sports Park at the foot of the mountain. It was already past three in the afternoon when I was coming down, and there were quite so may people in the park. In addition of fitness runners and children playing, there were also many people fishing along the Futain River. Some had very professional fishing equipment, while others simply tied fishing line to bamboo poles. The river water was relatively clear, and in the sunlight, you could slightly see the fish moving around. However, the number of fishermen seemed to outnumber the fish.

After a brief stay in the park, I set off for home. The day passed by without a specific purpose, and the holiday came to an end. It was a relaxing day that wasn't empty, providing a good opportunity to adjust my mindset. As for the new year, I won't make too many predictions, Days come and go, filled with both hope and worry.

Before leaving, I witnessed and interesting scene: on one side was a child pushing an elderly person in a wheelchair, and on the other side, a mother dragging her child alone.
